Overview

This SQLite database (ProMo1database.db) consists of two primary tables:

    Shops: Stores shop details such as shop number, address, status, and partner information.
    Sales: Records sales transactions, including details like sales date, reference number, quantity sold, and value paid.

The database was designed to handle frequent updates, ensuring flexibility to reflect changes like opening/closing shops or modifying transaction data. Later, business requests led to further modifications.
Installation Guide for SQLite and DB Browser for SQLite
Step 1: Install SQLite

SQLite is a lightweight, serverless SQL database engine.

    Download SQLite: Visit the official SQLite Download Page. Download the version for your operating system.
